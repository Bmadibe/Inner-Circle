      <p>Bella likes going out dancing all night and then complaining about being tired the next day while trying to get work done. When she says she couldn't get something done because she had too many other commitments, it's probably true, since she is a classic overcommitter. But that could also probably be solved by learning some better time management.</p>

      <p>We don't actually have a dog, but we figured if this was a website about procrastinating it should probably include a dog. We wish we had a dog, though considering our questionable track record with responsibility, maybe it is best we don't. </p>
